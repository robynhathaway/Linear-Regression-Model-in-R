# Linear-Regression-Model-in-R
# Created and analyzed a linear regression model in R to assess its performance. The project involved:
# - Loading, summarizing and cleaning a dataset
# - Splitting the dataset into a training and test dataset
# - Building a linear regression model and interpreting model summary statistics
# - Plotting and analyzing model residuals, predicting future values and calculating model error metrics. 
# This was a guided project through the Coursera Platform: https://coursera.org/share/f4cf27734fe42b4dbedb5a472aebe4b2
